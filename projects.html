        <h2>Primus - Mobile Card Game</h2>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/images/tree_draw.gif">
        </div>
        <p>I am currently working on a solo project for my final semester graduation project. PRIMUS is a Competitive DCCG with 1v1 PVE & potentially PVP game modes. It is a card game for android devices & PC, built within the Unity engine.</p>
        <p>I am responsible for programming, 3D modelling, texturing, VFX, SFX, UI, QA, etc. as part of this project.</p>
        <p>So far I have programmed the card systems, the deckbuilding, the AI system, and most of the gameplay. I have also worked on the VFX and 3D art for my game, primarily focusing on procedural and modular design.</p>

        <h2>EAI - Easy Android Installer</h2>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/images/eai.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>I researched UX issues that developers were having when installing .apk files from computer to Android devices. As a result, I found that users wished to see the simplification and user-friendliness of a standalone tool to handle the installation process.</p>
        <p>Using VS Code, PowerShell, Python3, and various Python Libraries (including tkinter, customtkinter, & pillow), I was able to program a tool that simplifies this process with a user-friendly interface and both a PythonScript & .exe version of this application avaliable. I published this tool publicly on my Gumroad site where it is currently avaliable for download.</p>

        <h2>BST - Blender Spacing Tool</h2>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/images/bst.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>I researched issues that users were having with the 3D modelling software Blender. As a result, I found that users (including a 3D artist at a AAA studio) wished to see the creation of a spacing tool similar to 3DsMax's spacing tool within Blender as the current workaround took too much time to setup and was quite awkward to use.</p>
        <p>Using VS Code, PowerShell, Python3, and Blender API, I was able to program a tool that enables similar functionality of the 3DsMax spacing tool but in Blender. I published this tool publicly on my Gumroad site where it is currently avaliable for download.</p>

        <h2>Modular SBSAR to UE5 Material</h2>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/images/sbsar.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>I created an SBSAR Substance Designer material, and using the Substance Designer 3D plugin for UE5, I ported and setup the SBSAR file in-engine.</p>
        <p>This allowed me to create a blendable material shader that allowed blending between multiple instances of the SBSAR - meaning I could tweak the wetness of the dirt allowing for puddles to culminate in certain areas.</p>
        <p>This workflow allows for fast and iterative material usage in UE5, and allows the designer to tweak the SBSAR instances to get different and unique effects entirely within engine.</p>

          <img class="project-img" src="public/images/tbmw.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>I have taken part in various game jams over the past few years. This includes the Global Game Jam 2022, Horror Jam #5, NI Student Game Jam 2022, and more.</p>
        <p>Generally I have been responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Programming & designing gameplay features & systems</li>
          <li>Debugging, merging, and fixing issues in code, assets, and materials/shaders</li>
          <li>Creating 3D Assets</li>
          <li>Creating materials, shaders, and textures</li>
          <li>Creating lighting, VFX, and Post-processing effects</li>
