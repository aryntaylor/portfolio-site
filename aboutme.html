      <p>Hi there, I'm Aryn.</p>
      <p>I'm a 20 year-old hard-working professional from Northern Ireland with a strong passion for programming, tools development, pipeline development, technical art, digital content creation (both 3D and 2D), and games development (specifically in Technical Art, Programming, and QA).</p>
      <p>I am skilled in using many different software tools in order to create models, composite & render scenes, program applications & tools, perform version control, project management, and much more.</p>
      <p>Some of these programs include Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Maya, 3dsMax, Substance Designer, Substance Painter, Azure DevOps, Jira, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, Sublime Text, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Vim, and much more.</p>
      <p>My programming experience is in Python, C#, C++, MaxScript, Blender API, Pixyz API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Rust. I also make frequent use of PowerShell, BASH, and CLI/Terminal.</p>
      <p>In my professional career I have created and delivered numerous high-quality tools for proprietary solutions in pipeline development. I have also personally created and publicly released several tools to GitHub and Gumroad for various DCC applications and engines.</p>
      <p>I have worked on testing (UX, Bug Hunting, and providing suggestions and feedback) for several studios including Electronic Arts (EA) and Outsider Games. </p>
      <p>I have also worked on several publicly avaliable game jam games, three college projects, large team projects, and I am constantly working on personal projects to improve and expand my skillset.</p>
      <p>I have also involved myself with volunteering opportunities including working as an Assistant Scout Leader (ASL) for The Scouts' Association - providing young people with invaluable skills. This includes teaching young people First Aid, Basic Programming & Graphic Design, Camping, and much more.</p>
      <p>I currently work as a Pipeline Developer with the VFX/CGI Production Team at Oliver Agency, which is based in London, United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Attention to detail and a focus on efficiency is a major cornerstone of my work. I strongly believe that the best projects rely on a concrete foundation of thorough R&D, Unittesting Frameworks, and well-maintained documentation for both developers and users.</p>
