      <p>Hi there, I'm Aryn.</p>
      <p>I'm a 20 year-old hard-working professional from Northern Ireland with a strong passion for programming, tools development, pipeline development, technical art, digital content creation (both 3D and 2D), and games development (specifically in Technical Art, Programming, and QA).</p>
      <p>I am skilled in using many different software tools in order to create models, composite & render scenes, program applications & tools, perform version control, project management, and much more.</p>
      <p>My programming experience is in Python, C#, C++, MaxScript, Blender API, Pixyz API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Rust. I also make frequent use of PowerShell, BASH, and CLI/Terminal.</p>
      <p>In my professional career I have created and delivered numerous high-quality tools for proprietary solutions in pipeline development. I have also personally created and publicly released several tools to GitHub and Gumroad for various DCC applications and engines.</p>
      <p>I have worked on testing (UX, Bug Hunting, and providing suggestions and feedback) for several studios including Electronic Arts (EA) and Outsider Games. </p>
      <p>I have also worked on several publicly avaliable game jam games, three college projects, large team projects, and I am constantly working on personal projects to improve and expand my skillset.</p>
      <p>Attention to detail and a focus on efficiency is a major cornerstone of my work. I strongly believe that the best projects rely on a concrete foundation of thorough R&D, Unittesting Frameworks, and well-maintained documentation for both developers and users.</p>
